.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Unidata units library, \fBudunits\fP, supports conversion of unit
specifications between formatted and binary forms, arithmetic
manipulation of unit specifications, and conversion of values between 
compatible scales of measurement.
.LP
A unit is the amount by which a physical quantity is measured.  For example:
.sp
.TS
center tab(|);
c c
c c.
Phisical Quantity|Possible Unit
\_|\_
time|weeks
distance|centimeters
power|watts
.TE
.sp
A unit can have an origin associated with it \-\- in which case
the unit and origin together define a scale.  For example, the
phrase "the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius" specifies a particular point on a
measurement scale; whereas the phrase "the temperature difference is
25 degrees Celsius" specifies a unit with no origin and, hence, no associated
scale.  If not remembered, this subtle distinction can cause problems when
handling units.
.LP
Because the units library passes pointers to units structures and FORTRAN
77 has no pointer type, the word PTR in the above synopsis stands for
whatever FORTRAN type is appropriate for holding a pointer to a C structure
on the given platform.  This is necessarily platform-dependent and,
consequently, \fBIT IS UP TO THE USER TO DECLARE AND USE THE CORRECT FORTRAN 
DATA TYPE\fR.
.LP
.B utopen()
initializes the units package.  If \fIpath\fP is not empty,
then it specifies a units file containing initializing unit definitions;
otherwise, the environment variable \fBUDUNITS_PATH\fR is checked and,
if it exits and is not empty, then it is assumed to contain the pathname
of the units file;
otherwise, a compile-time default pathname is used.
.sp
The definitions in the units file are read into memory.
This function returns 
0 on success, 
UT_ENOFILE if the units file doesn't exist,
UT_ESYNTAX if the units file contains a syntax error,
UT_EUNKNOWN if the units file contains an unknown specification,
UT_EIO if an I/O error occurred while accessing the units file, and
UT_EALLOC if a memory allocation failure occurred.
.LP
.B utdec()
decodes the formatted unit specification \fIspec\fP into a binary
unit representation and stores the result in \fIunit\fP.
The binary representation is used for algebraic manipulation.
This function returns 0 on success,
UT_ENOINIT if the package hasn't been initialized,
UT_EUNKNOWN if the specification contains an unknown unit, and
UT_ESYNTAX if the specification contains a syntax error.
.LP
.B utcaltime()
converts the amount, \fIvalue\fP, of the temporal unit, \fIunit\fP,
into a UTC-referenced date and time
(see, however, the section on HANDLING TIME).
The reference unit shall be a time unit and have an origin.
This function returns 0 on success,
UT_ENOINIT if the package hasn't been initialized and
UT_EINVALID if the unit structure is not a temporal one.
.LP
.B uticaltime()
converts a UTC-referenced date and time into
the amount, \fIvalue\fP, of the temporal unit, \fIunit\fP
(see, however, the section on HANDLING TIME).
The reference unit shall be a time unit and have an origin.
This function returns 0 on success,
UT_ENOINIT if the package hasn't been initialized and
UT_EINVALID if the unit structure is not a temporal one.
.LP
.B utcvt()
returns the coefficients of the Galilean transformation (i.e. y = a*x + b)
necessary to convert the \fIfrom\fP unit into the \fIto\fP unit.
The units must be compatible (i.e., their quotient must be dimensionless).
On successful return, \fIslope\fP and \fIintercept\fP will contain the 
values for the slope and intercept coefficients, respectively.
This function returns
0 on success,
UT_ENOINIT if the package hasn't been initialized,
UT_EINVALID if one of the unit variables is invalid, and
UT_ECONVERT if the units are not convertable.
.LP
.B utenc()
encodes the binary unit variable \fIunit\fP
into a formatted unit specification and stores the string in \fIspec\fP.
This function returns
0 on success,
UT_ENOINIT if the package hasn't been initialized,
UT_EINVALID if the unit variable is invalid, and
UT_ENOROOM if the supplied character buffer is too small.
.LP
.B utclr()
clears a unit variable by setting it to the dimensionless scalar 1.
.LP
.B uttime()
returns 1 if the given unit variable refers to a time unit; 0
otherwise.
This function ignores whether or not the unit has an origin.
.LP
.B utorigin()
returns 1 if the given unit variable has an origin (i.e. defines a scale)
and 0 otherwise.
.LP
.B utcpy()
copies the unit variable \fIsource\fP to the unit variable
\fIdest\fP.
This function correctly handles the case where the same unit variable
is referenced by the source and destination units.
.LP
.B utscal()
scales the unit variable \fIsource\fP by the multiplicative scalar
\fIfactor\fP, storing the result in the unit variable \fIresult\fP.
This function correctly handles the case where the same unit variable
is referenced by the source and result units.
.LP
.B utinv()
inverts the unit variable \fIsource\fP, storing the result in
unit variable \fIresult\fP.
Multiplying a unit by its reciprocal yields the
dimensionless scalar 1.
This function correctly handles the case where the source and result
unit refer to the same variable.
.LP
.B utdiv()
divides unit variable \fInumer\fP by unit variable \fIdenom\fP
and stores the result in unit variable \fIresult\fP.
This function correctly handles the case where the same unit variable
is referenced by two or more arguments.
.LP
.B utmult()
multiplies unit variable \fIterm1\fP by unit variable \fIterm2\fP
and stores the result in unit variable \fIresult\fP.
This function correctly handles the case where the same unit variable
is referenced by two or more arguments.
.LP
.B utexp()
raises the unit variable \fIsource\fP by the power \fPpower\fP,
storing the result in the unit variable \fIresult\fP.
This function correctly handles the case where the same unit variable
is referenced by the source and result units.
.LP
.B utcls()
terminates usage of this package.  In particular, it frees all allocated
memory.  It should be called when the library is no longer needed.
.LP
.B utmake()
Creates a new unit variable.  The value returned by this function may be
used in subsequent calls.  The unit variable is cleared by a call to utclr.
.LP
.B utfree()
Frees the unit variable \fIunit\fP which was returned by a previous call to
\fButmake()\fP.
.SH "HANDLING TIME"
.LP
The \fBudunits\fP(3) package uses a mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar
system.
Dates prior to 1582-10-15 are assumed to use the Julian calendar, which
was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BCE and is based on a year that 
is exactly 365.25 days long.
Dates on and after 1582-10-15 are assumed to use the Gregorian calendar,
which was introduced on that date and is based on a year that is
exactly 365.2425 days long.
(A year is actually approximately 365.242198781 days long.)
Seemingly strange behavior of the \fBudunits\fP(3) package can
result if a user-given time interval includes the changeover date.
For example, \fButCalendar\fP() and \fButInvCalendar\fP() can be used
to show that 1582-10-15 *preceeded* 1582-10-14 by 9 days.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
In the following, it is assumed that a FORTRAN INTEGER data type is
appropriate for storing a pointer to a C structure.  This assumption is
valid for most 32-bit architectures but is invalid for most
64-bit architectures that have 32-bit INTEGERs (e.g. a DEC Alpha).
.LP
Convert two data sets to
a common unit, subtract one from the other, then
save the result in a (different) output unit:

A unit is specified as an arbitrary product of constants and unit names
raised to arbitrary integral powers.
Division is indicated by a slash `/'.
Multiplication is indicated by whitespace, a period `.', or a hyphen `-'.
Exponentiation is indicated by an
integer suffix or by the exponentiation operators `^' and `**'.
Parentheses may be used for grouping and disambiguation.
.LP
Arbitrary Galilean transformations (i.e. y = ax + b) are supported.
In particular, temperature and time conversions are correctly handled.
The specification:
.sp
.RS
degF @ 32

.sp
indicates a Fahrenheit scale with the origin shifted to thirty-two
degrees Fahrenheit (i.e. to zero degrees Celsius).

Besides the character `\fB@\fP', the words `\fBafter\fP', `\fBfrom\fP',

Note that the origin-shift operation takes precedence over
multiplication.
In order of increasing precedence, the operations are division,
multiplication, origin-shift, and exponentiation.

The function
.B utPrint()
always encodes a unit specification one way.  To reduce
misunderstandings, it is recommended that
this encoding style be used as the default.  
In general, a unit is printed in terms of basic units, factors, and
exponents.
Basic units are separated by spaces; and any
exponent directly appends its associated unit.
The above examples would be printed as follows:

.SH "UNITS FILE"
.LP
The units file is a formatted file containing unit definitions and is
used to initialize this package.
It is the first place to look to discover the set of
valid names and symbols (of which there are many \-\-  On October 9, 1992, 
it contained 446 entries).
.LP
The format for the units file is documented internally and the file may be
modified by the user as necessary.  In particular, additional units and
constants may be easily added (including variant spellings of existing
units or constants).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP UDUNITS_PATH 17
If \fButInit()\fP
is called without a pathname argument, and if this environment variable is
non-empty, then its value overrides the default
pathname for the units file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

This package prints
(hopefully) self-explanatory error-messages to standard error.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
