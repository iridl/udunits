VERSION		CHANGE

1.11.7	1998-11-25
		Ported to the following systems:
		    AIX 4.3 (both /bin/c89 and /usr/vac/bin/c89)
		    HP-UX B.11.00.

1.11.6	1998-02-10
		Corrected definitions of "perm_0C" and "perm_23C" in the
		database.  The definitions used "Pa" before it was
		defined as "pascal".

		Added "L" as an abbreviation for "liter".

		Added declaration of the Fortran function UTICALTIME to
		the header-file "udunits.inc".

		Changed installation of manual pages on HP-UX systems: 
		the manual page is no longer preprocessed with tbl(1)
		and neqn(1) because the man(1) utility incorporates
		that.

                Corrected bug in Fortran UTENC() function: a blank
                output character variable no longer results in a
                UT_ENOROOM return status.

1.11.5	1997-08-18
		Corrected return value of valtocal(): it now matches the 
		specification (returns 0 on success).  Corrected "test.pl"
		to match.

		Corrected "test.pl" to not test clear() return value since 
		it doesn't have one.

1.11.4	1997-06-10
		Removed `-traditional' from gcc(1) example in INSTALL
		and CUSTOMIZE files because it doesn't work.

		Fixed bug in the dectime() of lib/utlib.c that caused 
		timestamps around 1925-01-01 (and erlier) to be 
		misinterpreted.

                Added caution to file INSTALL about building the perl
                extension module using the same environment that built
                the perl package.

		Modified FORTRAN header file "udunits.inc": should
		be more robust now and work under more compilers.

                Made more explicit in the README file what needs to be
                included in a request for help.

		Fixed udunits(3f) manual page: included missing file
		"testcal2.f" in the distribution and modified the
		build procedure to make "lib/udunits.3f" from
		"lib/udunits.3fi" and "lib/testcal2.f".

		Added missing "meters" to definition of "light_year"

		Ported to UNICOS-9/J90 (including Perl extension module).
		Something seems to be wrong with installing the new, static
		perl(1) utility, however.

		Ported to CFORTRAN version 3.9.

1.11.3	1996-12-2
                Corrected and updated the units database.  There were
                three major corrections due to typo's:
		
		    Unit		Was		Now Is
		    ----		---		------
		    assay_ton		2.916667e2 kg	2.916667e-2 kg
		    register_ton	3.831685 m3	2.831685 m3
		    pond		1.806650e-3 N	9.806650e-3 N
		
                Other modifications were basically updates to the
                conversion factors based on the latest information from
                the National Institute for Standards and Technology
                (NIST).  The database was originally bsed on the 1991
                "Guide for the Use of the International System of Units
                (SI)"; the more recent information is based on the 1995
                publication by the same name.  See the following URL for
                more information than you could possibly want:

		    http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div840/SI.html

1.11.2	1996-11-15
		Improved accounting for finite-precision in computations
		involving time.  Should eliminate incorrect utCalendar()
		returns when the time is an exact multiple of an
		integral number of seconds.

1.11.1	1996-11-14
                Improved support for generating `whatis' database:
                switched from use of catman(1)'s `-M' option to use of
                MANPATH environment variable.  This adds creation of the
                manual-page database to AIX and should provide better
                support for Linix.

                Added missing files (port/misc/udalloc.{c,h}) to
                distribution (sorry 'bout that) and tested installation
                from scratch.

                Improved accounting for finite-precision in computations
                involving time.  Should eliminate utCalendar() returns
                with 59 minutes and 60 seconds.

		Added function prototype for utInvCalendar() to UDUNITS
		header file (udunits.h).

1.11	1996-11-04
                Converted support for FORTRAN-calling-C from the fortc(1)
		utility to the `cfortran.h' header-file.

		Modified installation procedure to install the FORTRAN
		include file mentioned in the manual page (udunits.inc).

		Corrected definition of the International Table British
		Thermal Unit (It_Btu) from 1.055056 joules to 1.055056e3
		joules).

		Corrected error message when the database contains too
		many base units.

		Added `count' as a base unit.  Moved `bit' to a non-base
		unit of `count'.

		Added routine declarations to FORTRAN header-file
		(udunits.inc).

		Corrected spelling of `termporal' in the perl
		test-script.

		Fixed memory-leak in utTerm() (UTCLS) routine.

                Added ignoring of trailing whitespace in unit
                specifications.

1.10.8	1996-06-27
		Added missing file (port/fortc/bsdos.m4) to distribution.

1.10.7	1996-05-02
                Ported to BSD/OS 2.1 (but with no FORTRAN or perl
		support).

1.10.6	1996-04-23
		Added missing tfind() to package-supplied, portability
		functions (port/misc/tfind.c).

1.10.5	1996-04-19
		More corrections to accomodate ConvexOS (sigh):
		    1.  Made configure script consider typedefs as undefined
			if header-file doesn't exist.
		    2.  Added port/misc/search-node.h to MANIFEST.

1.10.4	1996-04-17
		Modified configuration mechanism to treat any function as
		undeclared if its header-file doesn't exist.

1.10.3	1996-04-16
		Added making of symbolic link from man/man3f/udunits.3f
		to man/man3/udunits.3f to accomodate SunOS 5.4.

		Ported master makefile to GNU make.  Should eliminate
		warnings about `ignoring old commands for target'.

		Added missing check for <limits.h> to configuration script
		(used by lib/utlib.fc).

		Added commentary about using a mixed Gregorian/Julian
		calendar system.

                Added support for systems that lack the tsearch(3)
                family of functions (e.g. at least on version of
                ConvexOS).

                Added support for systems that lack the ptrdiff_t type
                in <stddef.h> (e.g. at least on version of ConvexOS).

                Added support for systems that lack declarations for
                getenv(), strcpy(), and strncpy() in the appropriate
                header-files (at least on version of ConvexOS does this).

1.10.2	1995-10-19
		Dulled the rule for the `test' target in the udunits/
		subdirectory so that an output of `00.0000 UTC' compares
		equal to `00.00 UTC'.

		Corrected definition of installation directories bin & lib:
		before, they were mistakenly created as bin/bin and bin/lib.

1.10.1	1995-10-16
                Changed cannonical format for printing date and
                time.  The month, day, hours, & minutes fields
                are now printed with two digits and the seconds
                field is now printed with two digits before the
                decimal point.  Fields are left padded with 0's
                as necessary.  This change was made to conform
                to ISO8601:1988 Date/Time Representations (see
                http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html).

                Ported to UNICOS 8.0.4 and c89(1).

                Removed dependence of the `binftp' make(1) target on the
                `intstall' target.  This change should only affect the
		Unidata Program Center.

		Added commentary to README and INSTALL about version 5
		of perl being necessary.

1.10	1995-8-31
		Made changes to database:
		    Added 'firkin' (barrel/4) to database because my dad
		    stumped me on this one (figures).

		    Changed `mean_year' (365.2425 days) to `Gregorian_year'.

                    Changed definition of `year' from `mean_year'
                    to `tropical_year' (see the database file
                    lib/udunits.dat).

		    Corrected `lunar_month' from 29.530859 days to
		    29.530589 days.

                Changed handling of dates in library.  Removed
                requirement of valid Gregorian dates (i.e. on or after
                October 15, 1582) by extending algorithms to Julian day
                number 0 (January 1, 4713 BCE).

1.9.1	1995-8-8
		Corrected interpertation of PERL variable set to the
		empty string by the configure script.  It should now
		cause the perl 5 extension module to be ignored.

1.9	1995-8-4
                Added some additional units to the database; in
                particular `mean_year', `common_year', & `leap_year'.

                Changed definition of `year' from 365 days to
		`mean_year'.

		Changed directory layout: moved library stuff into lib/
		and udunits utility into udunits/

		Added perl extension module, UDUNITS.

1.8.2	1995-7-26
		Corrected I/O redirection syntax in INSTALL file.

		Ported makefiles to POSIX standard.

		Ported build mechanism UNICOS 8.0.2.

		Corrected bug that prevented the package-supplied 
		header-file float.h from being created on systems that
		don't have one.

1.8.1	1995-6-16
		Ported to new port/ directory-structure.

		Replaced bison-generated parser with OSF/1-generated one
		to eliminate dependence on alloca().

1.8	1995-6-6
		Made more robust the determination of whether or not
		the units database defines `second'.

		Migrated to bison(1) and flex(1) from yacc(1) and lex(1)
		in order to generate a parser and scanner that is
		specific to this package (i.e. that won't interfere with
		other scanners and parsers).  The prefix is `ut'.  This
		entailed adding a portable alloca().

		Ported to autoconf 2.3.

		Added `const' to appropriate arguments of API functions.

1.7.2	1995-2-8
		Eliminated installing of `port' stuff when making `all'
		target to allow user to build as self but install as
		root.

		Ported to /bin/cc under SunOS 4.1.3.

                Ensured that `distclean' target also performs `clean'
		action.

1.7.1   1994-12-16
                Fixed bug that prevented conversions between units with
                origins (e.g. Celsius) and those without (e.g. Kelvin).

                Fixed bug in shifting the origin of a unit that, itself,
                had an origin (e.g. `Celsius @ 100').  Thanks to Harry
                Edmon at the University of Washington.

1.7	1994-12-15
		Added utInvCalendar() (FORTRAN: UTICALTIME) to convert
		a Gregorian date and time into a time-unit-based scalar
		value.

                Fixed bug that caused interpretation of `ms' as a
                plural form of `meter' rather than as 'milliseconds'.

                Added to units database: `degree_west', `work_year', and
                `work_month'.

                Corrected definition of `slug': it was an order of
                magnitude too small.

		Modified library to permit product of unit with origin
		and scalar and division of unit with origin by scalar.

		Converted configuration engineering support to autoconf
		2.1.

		Ported to HP-UX A.09.05.

		Added casts to eliminate some compiler warnings.

                Modified lexical analyzer to allow `60' in seconds
                field.

                Fixed printing of time origin to eliminate `60' in
                seconds field.

1.6.3	1993-10-5
		Ported to Solaris 2.1: changed bcopy() to memmove() in 
		udunits.c for better POSIX compliance.

1.6.2	1993-6-14
		Corrected test for conforming <float.h>.

1.6.1	1993-6-11
		Ported to OSF1.

		Simplified file `configure.in' consonant with new
		autoconf(1) support.

		Made `configure' script more robust.  It now works under 
		UNICOS and SunOS 5.1 (alias Solaris).

		Removed extraneous function prototype for julnum() from
		utlib.fc.

1.6		Added the functions to support users who wish to explicitly 
		handle time.
		    C:		utCalendar(value, unit, year, month, day
					   hour, minute, second)
		    FORTRAN:	UTCALTIME(value, UNIT, YEAR, MONTH, DAY
					  HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND)

		Modified the FORTRAN API to support platforms having
		pointers that are larger than integers (e.g. DEC's Alpha).
		As a consequence, it is up to the FORTRAN user to 
		    1) declare the return value of UTMAKE() appropriately; and 
		    2) use an appropriately capacious data type for holding
		       the unit-structure pointers.

		Upgraded the `configure' generator to autoconf(1) 1.3.  This
		should result in better `configure' scripts -- especially
		for AIX and OSF1.

1.5		Added the following SI prefixes:
		    yotta	1e24
		    zetta	1e21
		    zepto	1e-21
		    yocto	1e-24

		Modified udgetprefix() so that it returns an empty string,
		"", rather than NULL if an appropriate installation prefix 
		can't be found; thus preventing a subsequent crash.

1.4.2		Corrected port/Makefile.in so that it knows how to make
		`fortc/{all,install,clean,...}'.

		Eliminated warning message from some compilers about
		multiple definitions for `utdebug'.

1.4.1		Replaced compile-time default pathname for the units file 
		with run-time determination based on several possibilities,
		the last of which is the Unidata user account.

1.4		Added FORTRAN interface and associated manual page.

1.3.2           Increased precision of values printed by utPrint() to
		maximum number of decimal digits guaranteed by the
		compiler.

1.3.1		Removed dependence on lex(1) runtime library for the
		function yywrap().  Thus, referencing the lex library (-ll)
		is no longer necessary for programs linking against the
		udunits(3) library.

1.3		Switched from hand-coded C lexical analyzer to a
		lex(1)-generated one.

		Added support for temporal specifications of the form

			milliseconds since 1992-10-17 15:10:42.57 -600
